# Awesome WM Widgets

Widgets for the awesome window manager (https://awesomewm.org/)

**Includes:**
- Battery
- Wifi

## Installation

Clone repo into `~/.config/awesome`, require in `rc.lua` and add to a layout, like `right_layout:add(wifiwidget)` in case you've required it via `local wifiwidget = require 'widgets.wifi'` (it is in `widgets` folder).

You need **Font Awesome** for the icons to work (http://fontawesome.io/).
